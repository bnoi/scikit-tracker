**scikit-tracker** aims to be a robust Python library to work with cell
biology microscopy images. `OME XML and OME Tiff`_ are supported to
handle input/output to the lib. The two main goals of the library is to
implement **detection** and **tracking** algorithms relevant to analyse
biological microscopy dataset.

Several algorithms are featured and it is planned to add others:

-  **Gaussian peak detection** by deflation loop : `Segré et al. Nature
   Methods (2008)`_

- **Cell boundary detection** with bright field depth fitting : `Julou, T., PNAS, (2013)`_

-  **Cell nucleus segmentation** : by Guillaume Gay

-  **Lap Tracker**, a robust single-particle tracking : `K. Jaqaman and G.
   Danuser, Nature Methods, 2008`_. The version implemented in
   **scikit-tracker** is a slightly modified version from the original
   to allow easy, flexible and yet powerfull parameters adjustements
   with custom cost function.

.. note::
    **scikit-tracker** and ``sktracker`` refer to the same thing. However **scikit-tracker** may be used more as a project name while ``sktracker`` as a Python module.

.. warning::

    **scikit-tracker** is in very early stage development. API is still highly instable and you should not use it in production. However any kind of contributions is welcome. We hope to provide soon a 0.2 release with main features working and stable.
